          <p className="font-bold">What is Port scanning?</p>
          <p>
            It is a process of probing a computer network to determine which ports are open and potentially accepting connections.
            It involves sending packets to multiple ports on a target system and then analysing its response to identify open, closed or filtered ports.
            Think of it as a robber walking around the neighbour checking for unlocked doors. If there is an unlocked door, they can prepare to enter the house
            and start a robbery.
          </p>
          <p className="font-bold">What is Port?</p>
          <p>
            A port is a virtual point where network connections start and end. 
            Ports are used to identify specific processes or services running on a device. Each port is associated with a unique number, 
            ranging from 0 to 65535.
            For example, port 80 is typically used for HTTP (web) traffic, and port 443 is used for HTTPS (secure web) traffic.
          </p>      
          <p className="mt-2">
            Each port can respond in one of the following ways:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Open:</strong> The port is active and accepting connections.
              This means a service (like a web server or database) is running and reachable. Attackers may target these for vulnerabilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Closed:</strong> The port is accessible but no service is listening on it. 
              It confirms the system is reachable, but that specific port isn‚Äôt currently in use.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Filtered:</strong> The port appears blocked by a firewall or security device. 
              The scanner receives no response or an error, making it hard to tell whether the port is open or closed.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Port scanning is commonly used by security professionals to identify and secure vulnerable entry points, 
            but it is also used by attackers during the reconnaissance phase of a cyberattack.
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold">Consequences of being Port scanned?</p>
          <p> The severity of a Port scan is between low to medium. Port scanning alone doesn‚Äôt cause damage, but it‚Äôs an important 
            early stage attack that leads to more serious threats if not monitored or blocked. Port scanning reveals open ports, running services
            and potential vulnerabilities. Hackers can then prepare for more exploits such as bruteforcing password, delivering malware
            on these open ports depending on its response.
          </p>
          <p className="font-bold">How to prevent Port Scanning?</p>

          <p>
            While we can't completely stop port scanning, there are several strategies to reduce their effectiveness and occurence:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
            <li><strong>Use Firewalls:</strong> Configure firewalls to block or filter unused ports and 
              restrict access based on IP address or traffic type.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Disable Unused Services:</strong> Turn off services that aren‚Äôt 
              necessary to reduce the number of open ports.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Enable Port Knocking:</strong> A technique where ports remain closed 
              unless a user sends a specific sequence of packets to ‚Äúunlock‚Äù them.
            </li>
          </ul>
