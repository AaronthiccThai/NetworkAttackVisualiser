DNS Tunneling
- DNS tunneling is a method of hiding data or commands inside DNS queries/responses to bypass firewalls
- To simulate we cna do smth like:
1. Victim malware → sends encoded DNS query → 
2. Trusted DNS server (e.g. 8.8.8.8) →
  Since the server doesn't know the answer, it ask root DNS server, where it ask the evil domain
3. Forwarded to evil-domain.com’s name server (attacker controlled) →
4. Attacker decodes query & sends DNS response with command →
5. Malware receives command via DNS response →
6. Malware executes and repeats (covert channel established)
Each of these are a 'block' in frontend

- Also explain DNS, DNS queries easily
- Prevention - monitor traffic/network, firewall, restriction, inspection, actual testing by self hacking, limiting rate of DNS requests,
  perhaps use machine learning

- Idea is to showcase different phsae of attacksand summarise what is happening
  - Also add how users can simulate DNS tunneling by creating their own malicious domain, then having someone input this evil domain.Then 
  user can fetch the victim's info or smth.
SYNFlood
-A SYN flood is a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack that overwhelms a server by sending many half-open TCP connections.
- Explain what SYN,ACK, SYN-ACK, TCP cnnection summarisation and prevention oof SYN flood

- Idea is to showcase perhaps traffic of a website using a graph or smth, and then implement some interactin that mimics slow website i.e register not working
PortScan
- A port scan is a technique used to probe a server or network host for open ports and discover which services are running.
- Explain port - connection point between two network - identify certain process - DONE
- Explain prevention - simple methods such as firewall, disable unused ports, and port knocking
- Idea was to have multiple ports, user can be in perspective of attacker and scan these ports
  - Then, ports that are open can be followed up with attack
