DNS Tunneling
- DNS tunneling is a method of hiding data or commands inside DNS queries/responses to bypass firewalls
- To simulate we cna do smth like:
1. Victim malware → sends encoded DNS query → 
2. Trusted DNS server (e.g. 8.8.8.8) →
  Since the server doesn't know the answer, it ask root DNS server, where it ask the evil domain
3. Forwarded to evil-domain.com’s name server (attacker controlled) →
4. Attacker decodes query & sends DNS response with command →
5. Malware receives command via DNS response →
6. Malware executes and repeats (covert channel established)

Each of these are a 'block' in frontend
