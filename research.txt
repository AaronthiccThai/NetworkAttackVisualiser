DNS Tunneling
- DNS tunneling is a method of hiding data or commands inside DNS queries/responses to bypass firewalls
- To simulate we cna do smth like:
1. Victim malware → sends encoded DNS query → 
2. Trusted DNS server (e.g. 8.8.8.8) →
  Since the server doesn't know the answer, it ask root DNS server, where it ask the evil domain
3. Forwarded to evil-domain.com’s name server (attacker controlled) →
4. Attacker decodes query & sends DNS response with command →
5. Malware receives command via DNS response →
6. Malware executes and repeats (covert channel established)
Each of these are a 'block' in frontend

- Also explain DNS, DNS queries easily
- Prevention - monitor traffic/network, firewall, restriction, inspection, actual testing by self hacking, limiting rate of DNS requests,
  perhaps use machine learning

  https://www.brightsec.com/blog/dns-tunneling/  

- Idea is to showcase different phsae of attacksand summarise what is happening
  - Also add how users can simulate DNS tunneling by creating their own malicious domain, then having someone input this evil domain.Then 
  user can fetch the victim's info or smth.

  Consequences
    Data exfiltration from internal networks (e.g., credentials, system data).
    Command & control (C2) channels established undetected, allowing persistent malware operation.
    Hard to detect with traditional firewalls.
  Prevention
  Block known tunneling domains.
  DNS traffic rate limiting.
  More etcetc.
SYNFlood
-A SYN flood is a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack that overwhelms a server by sending many half-open TCP connections.
- Explain what SYN,ACK, SYN-ACK, TCP cnnection summarisation and prevention oof SYN flood

  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TCP_handshake
- Idea is to showcase perhaps traffic of a website using a graph or smth, and then implement some interactin that mimics slow website i.e register not working

  Consequences
    Server becomes unresponsive to legitimate traffic.
    Real users experience lag, errors, or full outages.
    May require server reboot or scaling infrastructure.
  Prevention
    Syn cookies
    Firewall rules
    tcp connection timeout
    Cloud based DDos protection
PortScan
- A port scan is a technique used to probe a server or network host for open ports and discover which services are running.
- Explain port - connection point between two network - identify certain process - DONE
- Explain prevention - simple methods such as firewall, disable unused ports, and port knocking
- Idea was to have multiple ports, user can be in perspective of attacker and scan these ports
  - Then, ports that are open can be followed up with attack

  Consequences
    Reveals vulnerable services to attacker 
    Often a precursor to exploits or lateral movement.
    Might allow unauthorised access, data theft, or DoS.
  Prevention
    Firewalls - improve itmaybe
    Disable Unused Services
    Port knocking - secret code or something to connect to port
