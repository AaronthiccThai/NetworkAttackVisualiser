# PacketNetworkVisualiser

## Installation
This was done on WSL Unbuntu, so it is best to start it on the same subsystem

To run this program, git clone the repository (https version)

Then give permission to the start.sh file - chmod 755 start.sh. Then run the file and on your terminal, there should be a localhost.
Don't use the popup localhost but one on terminal since the popup gives to an invalid url. The port should be user forwarded and not auto forwarded
